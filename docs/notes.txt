Need:
    Linked List: In Stack/Queue implementation
    Vector: Array of waypoints ordered by user-selected resource
        When user wants to look at a given resource, provide a list of all waypoints
        ordered by value of that resource

    Sorting algorithm: quicksort to arrange list of waypoints by resource value
        See vector

    Stack: undo button
        Stack of recent changes made that can be undone
        Contains pairs of (pointer to variable, original value)

    Set: manageable resources
        Set of the different resources that the user measures

    Hashtable: separate chaining, stores all waypoints, hash function takes in name
        User can search a specific waypoint by name easily

    Decision Tree: menu
        menu flowchart
